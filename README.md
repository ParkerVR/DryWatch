What it does
A drought prediction tool that enables users to stay conscious of their water consumption in preparation for droughts.

How we built it
Combined historic rainfall and drought information via RNN with back-propagation to produce projections of future droughts.

Challenges we ran into
Mapping APIs was difficult.
Difficult to decide on the best method of data analysis.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Addressed three different types of customers and catered to their pains and needs.

What we learned
There are many ways to reduce water consumption.
There are technologies that exist for drought predictions that can be integrated with DryWatch.
The effect humans have on the severity of droughts.

What's next for DryWatch
Improve prediction accuracy, and calculate the severity and duration of drought, and how far into the future that can be predicted
